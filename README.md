# Hi, I’m Kardelen 👋

I’m a frontend developer.  
Watching my design ideas take shape in code makes me genuinely happy —  
so I do what makes me happy in this life:✨ I keep creating new things.✨  

Besides coding, I enjoy cooking and taking care of my plants.🌿🌿

I’m really happy to share what I learn with others and see them get better.🫰🏽 That’s why I try to spend as much time as possible on my [blog](https://medium.com/@KardelenCodes).
